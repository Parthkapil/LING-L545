# Fake News Detection in Hindi Language Using Ensemble Learning

Due to the exponential growth in online infor- mation, it has become easier to consume news on online platforms. Unfortunately, this quick and easy access to the news has also made it convenient to spread fake and unreliable infor- mation. Fake news has the potential to cause extreme harm to individuals or society. Hence, fake news detection is one of the emerging research topic in todayâ€™s era. Spreading fake news is a common issue in countries with lower literacy rates like India. Therefore, a sys- tem is required to flag the news as fake or not-fake in order to inform people about the news they are consuming. This project suggests an automatic classification method based on ensem- ble learning techniques for news items. This project investigates many textual characteris- tics that can be utilized to distinguish between authentic and fraudulent content where various machine learning algorithms are trained using ensemble approaches based on those character- istics and assess their performance on two real- world datasets.
